      <p>
        Besides coding I love to fill my life with a lot of things and
        activities. Here you can find some of themâ€¦

        <h2>Plants and gardening</h2>
        <p>
          I love nature, especially all kinds of plants. This is why I
          spend a lot of time in my garden and have almost too many indoor
          plants at home. Here's a list of my favorite ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Croton</li>
          <li>Dracaena</li>
          <li>Pilea peperomioides</li>
          <li>Zamioculcas zamiifolia</li>
          <li>Spider plant</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Music and record collection</h2>
        <p>
          Next to my plants there's my record player. And a collection
          of already 150 records and counting. After a long day
          I love spending the evening with a glass of red wine and
          listening to music.
