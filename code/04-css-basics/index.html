    <h1>Hello, my name is Lara!</h1>
    <p>
      I am a developer and a musician. This is a small website I created
      during a web development tutorial. I like the web and all the awesome
      features of HTML and CSS.

    <h2>This is me</h2>
    <p>
      I not only like web development and music but also cats. This is me with
      my cat Gandalf (the white).

    <h2>My projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Shopping list application</h3>
        <p>
          I never go shopping without a list. I couldn't find an application
          that suit my needs, so I wrote my own.
        </p>

        <h3>Museum website</h3>
        <p>
          A friend of mine works in a museum and asked me if I could build a
          website for them. I said yes.

        <h3>Snake in the browser</h3>
        <p>
          I loved playing "Snake" on my mobile phone back in the late 90s.
          Last year I built a version you can play online in the browser.
