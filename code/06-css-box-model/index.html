      <h1>Hello, my name is Lara!</h1>
      <p>
        I am a developer and a musician. This is a small website I created
        during a web development tutorial. I like the web and all the awesome
        features of HTML and CSS.

          I not only like web development and music but also cats. This is me with
          my cat Gandalf (the white).

            <h3>Shopping list application</h3>
            <p>
              I never go shopping without a list. I couldn't find an application
              that suit my needs, so I wrote my own.

            <h3>Museum website</h3>
            <p>
              A friend of mine works in a museum and asked me if I could build a
              website for them. I said yes.

            <h3>Snake in the browser</h3>
            <p>
              I loved playing "Snake" on my mobile phone back in the late 90s.
              Last year I built a version you can play online in the browser.
